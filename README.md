## App requirements

You need to have installed [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system to run the development server.

## Install the project

Run `npm install` to download all the app dependencies.

## Start development server

Run `npm start` for a webpack dev local server. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Run test

Run `npm test` to execute all the functional and render test configured for the App, if you want to leave the test executer in "watch mode", just run `npm run test-w` and all the tests will run automatically when you change any of the source files.
